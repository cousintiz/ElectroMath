## Resistor Calculator – README

**Website**: [https://rescalcs.netlify.app/](https://rescalcs.netlify.app/)

### Introduction
Welcome to **Resistor Calculator**, a **free and open** resource for quickly computing resistor values in various configurations and referencing essential electronics knowledge. Developed in **2023**, this tool was born out of the need to avoid the tedium of manual calculations—now, anyone can use it to get instant results.

### Features
1. **Series & Parallel Calculations**  
   - Quickly sum resistors in series or compute the equivalent for parallel networks.

2. **Delta-Star & Star-Delta Transforms**  
   - Convert between Δ (triangle) and Y (star) configurations for three-resistor networks.

3. **Series-Parallel Combinations**  
   - Combine groups of series-connected resistors in parallel (or vice versa) to find total resistance.

4. **Color Code Calculator**  
   - Identify 4-band resistor values using color-coded dropdowns. Includes a reference table for all standard resistor color bands.

5. **Resistance of a Conductor**  
   - Calculate wire resistance using \( R = \rho \times \frac{L}{A} \).

6. **Educational Content**  
   - Quick references to key electrical laws (Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, Joule’s Law) and resistor fundamentals.

7. **Theme Toggle**  
   - Switch between a light and a more subdued dark theme for comfortable viewing.

8. **Responsive Design**  
   - Built with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), the site is optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Purpose
- **Accessibility**: Provide a free, user-friendly calculator for hobbyists, students, and engineers.
- **Efficiency**: Save time and effort—no more tedious manual resistor calculations.
- **Education**: Serve as a convenient reference for fundamental electrical laws and resistor color coding.
- **Open & Extensible**: Allow anyone to contribute, adapt, or expand the tool as needed.

### How to Use
1. **Select a Configuration**  
   - On the **Calculator** page, choose your resistor configuration (series, parallel, delta-star, etc.) and input the values.
2. **Compute**  
   - Click **Calculate** to instantly see total resistance or transformation results.
3. **Color Code**  
   - Use the **Color Codes** page to determine resistor values and tolerances from color bands.
4. **Conductor Resistance**  
   - Enter resistivity (\(\rho\)), length (\(L\)), and cross-sectional area (\(A\)) to compute conductor resistance.
5. **Theme Toggle**  
   - Tap the **moon/sun** icon in the navbar to switch between light and dark themes.

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5 & Bootstrap 5**: For a responsive layout and clean, modern UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles resistor calculations, color code logic, and dynamic UI elements.
- **Netlify**: Hosts the site at [https://rescalcs.netlify.app/](https://rescalcs.netlify.app/) for free, easy deployment.
